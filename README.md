***Machine Learning to Identify the Top Features Driving Successful Bookings for British Airways Customers***

Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different from what it used to be. Today, if I'm hoping that a customer purchases my flights or holidays as they come into the airport, I've already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This is possible with the use of data and predictive models. The most important factor with a predictive model is the quality of the data I use to train the machine learning algorithms. For this task, I must manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data so that I can build a high-quality predictive model.

With my predictive model, it is important to interpret the results to understand how "predictive" the data really was and whether I can feasibly use it to predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays). Therefore, I should evaluate the model's performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive model's power.
